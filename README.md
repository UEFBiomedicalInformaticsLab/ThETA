ThETA: Transcriptome-driven Efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery

This R package was built to provide the implementation of novel trasncriptome-based efficacy scores of target(gene)-disease associations, which have been recentely described in [Failli et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46293-7). It provides utility functions to recompile the scores based on the selection of different disease-relevant gene sets and tissue-specific gene expresstion profiles. Morevoer, it provides the users with an easy access to the disease-gene association scores compiled by the [Open Target platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) and functions to merge the OT-based scores with our novel efficacy scores in order to provide a final prioritization of target(gene)-disease associations. Finally, the users can run basic visualization functions in order to visualize the tissue-specific gene networks and biological annotations associated to top drug targets (or genes) and closely related genes slected with a random walk algorithm. 

## Installation

As a pre-requisite, you need to have BioConductor and a set of BioConductor packages installed, you can do this with:

```r
# Install BioConductor
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()

# Install required BioConductor packages
BiocManager::install(c("MIGSA", "clusterProfiler", "enrichplot", "supraHex", "ReactomePA", "graph", "Rgraphviz", "MeSH.db", "BiocStyle"))
```

You can install ThETA from GitHub by using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package. 

If you do not have devtools installed, you can do so by:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

and then to install ThETA:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("vittoriofortino84/ThETA")
```
The above code will not build vignettes by default because theyâ€™re time consuming and may require additional packages.

To build the vignette use the following code. It will take approximately 13 minutes.  
```r
install_github("vittoriofortino84/ThETA", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
Note: the building process of the vignettes takes more than 15 minutes. This is why we provide a pre-compiled version accessible from this Git-hub page:

[Introduction](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vittoriofortino84/ThETA/blob/master/Introduction.html)


```r
browseVignettes('ThETA')
vignette("Introduction", package = "ThETA")
vignette("DataProcessing", package = "ThETA")
```
